# Simulation Engine in C++

This folder contains the C++ simulation engine for advanced quantitative research. It provides high-performance implementations for Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic modeling.

## Files
- `simulation_engine.cpp`: Core simulation engine entry point.
- `monte_carlo.cpp`: Implements Monte Carlo simulations.
- `stochastic_models.cpp`: Implements stochastic models like Geometric Brownian Motion.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration for CMake.

## How to Build and Run
1. Install CMake: [CMake Installation Guide](https://cmake.org/install/)
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
3. Run the simulation engine:
    ./SimulationEngine
