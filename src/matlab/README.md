# MATLAB Modules

This folder contains MATLAB scripts for stochastic modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, risk analysis, advanced visualizations, automated integration with TensorFlow, and comprehensive report generation.

## Enhanced Features
1. **TensorFlow Integration**:
   - Loads TensorFlow model predictions into MATLAB for further analysis.
   - Compares actual and predicted values, visualizing insights.

2. **Comprehensive Reporting**:
   - Automatically generates professional reports combining MATLAB outputs.
   - Includes latency trends, arbitrage opportunities, and comparison plots.

## Files
- `visualizations.m`: Generates and exports latency trends, arbitrage plots, and comprehensive reports.
- `data_processing.m`: Loads TensorFlow predictions and processes data from multiple sources.
- `stochastic_models.m`: Simulates asset prices with multidimensional correlation.
- `monte_carlo.m`: Performs Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty estimation.
- `risk_analysis.m`: Calculates financial risk metrics like VaR and CVaR.

## How to Use
1. Preprocess data using `data_processing.m`.
2. Perform simulations with `monte_carlo.m` or `stochastic_models.m`.
3. Analyze risk metrics using `risk_analysis.m`.
4. Visualize trends and opportunities using `visualizations.m`.
5. Integrate TensorFlow predictions and generate comprehensive reports.

## Future Goals
- Extend stochastic models to include jump-diffusion processes.
- Automate real-time TensorFlow model integration for streaming predictions.
- Build dynamic dashboards for interactive data exploration.
