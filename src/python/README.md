# Methodology: Monte Carlo and Stochastic Models

## Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo methods involve simulating the behavior of assets under uncertainty by generating random variables. These simulations are used to assess possible outcomes for asset prices.

## Stochastic Modeling
Stochastic models, such as Geometric Brownian Motion, simulate asset prices based on differential equations, incorporating drift and random shocks.

# Python Modules

This folder contains Python scripts for advanced quantitative research, including simulations, modeling, and risk analysis.

## Modules
- `monte_carlo.py`: Monte Carlo simulation for asset price modeling.
- `stochastic_models.py`: Implements stochastic models like GBM and mean-reverting processes.
- `optimization.py`: Portfolio optimization using Mean-Variance Optimization.
- `data_processing.py`: Data loading and preprocessing.
- `risk_analysis.py`: Calculates financial risk metrics like VaR and CVaR.
- `utilities.py`: Helper functions for logging and formatting.

## How to Use
1. Load data using `data_processing.py`.
2. Simulate price paths with `monte_carlo.py` or `stochastic_models.py`.
3. Perform risk analysis using `risk_analysis.py`.
4. Optimize portfolio weights using `optimization.py`.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more stochastic models.
- Integrate data from live feeds or APIs.
- Build a web interface for running simulations and visualizing results.
